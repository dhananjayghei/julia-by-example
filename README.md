## Julia by example

This repository contains examples for getting started with `Julia`. It
assumes that you know a little bit about programming,
econometrics, and DSGE models. It also assumes that you have Julia
installed on your system. The examples are organized as a series of
Jupyter Notebooks in their respective repositories. 

The directory contains four different sub-directories:

1. `basics` - This repo contains the basics of Julia such as:
   - understanding Julia objects such as Vectors, Matrices,
    DataFrames,
   - working around with `DataFrames`,
   - writing `Julia` functions,
   - sorting, and
   - handling missing data.
2. `econometrics` - This repo contains examples of doing regressions
   such as:
   a. ordinary least squares,
   b. generalized least squares,
   c. instrumental variables regression,
   d. maximum likelihood estimation,
   e. panel data regressions,
   f. time-series regressions, and
   g. bootstrapping
3. `macroeconomics` - This repo contains some examples of solving
   dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models in `Julia`. Some of
   them are:
   a. deterministic growth model,
   b. stochastic growth model,
   c. finite horizon dynamic programming,
   d. 
4. `machine-learning` - This repo contains some examples of solving
   machine learning models in `Julia`. 
   a. principal component analysis, principal component regression, 
   b. linear discrimnant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, 
   c. K-means clustering
