## Julia by example

This repository contains examples for getting started with `Julia`. It
assumes that you know a little bit about programming,
econometrics, and DSGE models. It also assumes that you have Julia
installed on your system. The examples are organized as a series of
Jupyter Notebooks in their respective repositories. 

The directory contains four different sub-directories:

1. `basics` - This repo contains the basics of Julia such as:
   - understanding Julia objects such as Vectors, Matrices,
    DataFrames,
   - working around with `DataFrames`,
   - writing `Julia` functions,
   - sorting, and
   - handling missing data.
2. `econometrics` - This repo contains examples of doing regressions
   such as:
   - ordinary least squares,
   - generalized least squares,
   - instrumental variable regressions,
   - maximum likelihood estimation,
   - panel data regressions,
   - time-series regressions, and
   - bootstrapping
<!-- 3. `macroeconomics` - This repo contains some examples of solving -->
<!--    dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models in `Julia`. Some of -->
<!--    them are: -->
<!--    a. deterministic growth model, -->
<!--    b. stochastic growth model, -->
<!--    c. finite horizon dynamic programming, -->
<!--    d.  -->
<!-- 4. `machine-learning` - This repo contains some examples of solving -->
<!--    machine learning models in `Julia`.  -->
<!--    a. principal component analysis, principal component regression,  -->
<!--    b. linear discrimnant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis,  -->
<!--    c. K-means clustering -->
